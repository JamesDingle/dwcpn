- [x] Refactor surface light calculations out of main loop and into their own set of functions
- [x] Refactor creation of light profile out of the compute_pp function
- [ ] Rename chl_profile to something along the lines of 'productive_biomass'
- [ ] Test it is working with one alternative productive biomass (i.e. Pro1)
- [ ] Add funcionality to compute across more than one productive biomass variable (i.e. Pro1, Pro2)
